# 💼 Portfolio Website 💼

Welcome to my Portfolio! This is a dark-light contrast website for showcasing my work as a web developer. It can be customized for any type of portfolio. The site includes custom JavaScript for a typewriter effect and uses the "Lightbox" script for project modals.

## 🚀 Usage

This website is built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). It uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons.

### Prerequisites

To customize this website, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installation

Clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install Bootstrap, Sass, and Font Awesome.

### Building CSS

To build your CSS files from Sass, run:

```bash
npm run sass:build
```

### Watching Sass Files

To watch your Sass files for changes, run:

```bash
npm run sass:watch
```

### Customization

You can add Bootstrap variables to the `bootstrap.scss` file. Refer to `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/scss/_variables.scss` for a list of all the variables. **Do NOT edit the `variables.scss` file directly**, as it will be overwritten when you update Bootstrap.

To add your own custom styles, use the `styles.scss` file.
